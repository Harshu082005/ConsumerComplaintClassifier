# ConsumerComplaintClassifier
This project implements a text classification model for consumer complaints. The model predicts the product category of a complaint based on its narrative text. It uses TF-IDF vectorization for text representation and compares multiple machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM (Linear Kernel), and Random Forest.
