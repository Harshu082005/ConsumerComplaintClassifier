# ConsumerComplaintClassifier
This project implements a text classification model for consumer complaints. The model predicts the product category of a complaint based on its narrative text. It uses TF-IDF vectorization for text representation and compares multiple machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM (Linear Kernel), and Random Forest.
This project performs text classification on consumer complaints using machine learning models. The dataset contains complaint narratives along with the product/service category.

1.Models used:

3. Project Overview

The project workflow includes:

Loading and inspecting the dataset (.csv)

Preprocessing text data

Mapping product categories to numeric labels

Vectorizing text using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Splitting dataset into training and test sets

Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)

Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Making predictions on new complaint text
